- Enterprise: $2,499/mo ($24,990/year)

- Pro: $14.99/mo ($179.88/year)

- Lifetime: $399 (one-time)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Homepage pricing now matches business plan exactly

**Correct:** $14.1T (Trillion)  
**Source:** Business Plan page 5

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** on Investors page

---

### 3. ⚠️ **MISSING KEY MARKET METRICS**

**Added:**
