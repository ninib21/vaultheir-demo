## 🌐 **Current Demo Site Numbers:**

### ❌ INCORRECT on Demo:
- **TAM:** Shows "$50B+" 
  - **SHOULD BE:** $14.1 Trillion

### ❌ INCORRECT Pricing (Before My Fix):
- Showed only 3 tiers (Free, Pro $29, Enterprise)
  - **SHOULD BE:** 5 tiers (Free Forever, Plus $4.99, Pro $14.99, Enterprise Family $24.99, Lifetime $399)

---

## ✅ **What I Just Fixed:**

### 1. Pricing Tiers - UPDATED ✅
Changed from 3 tiers to 5 tiers matching the business plan:

- ✅ Pro - $14.99/mo ($179.88 annual) [highlighted]
- ✅ Enterprise Family - $24.99/mo ($299.88 annual)
- ✅ Lifetime - $399 (one-time)

### 2. Grid Layout - UPDATED ✅
- Changed to 5-column grid (responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 5 col desktop)
- All tiers fit across the page
- Proper spacing and sizing

## 🔧 **What STILL NEEDS Fixing:**

### TAM Value
**Current:** $50B+
**Should be:** $14.1T (Trillion)

Let me fix this now...
